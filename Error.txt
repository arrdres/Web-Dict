Can't read record in system table
Sort aborted
Out of sort memory; increase server sort buffer size
Too many connections
Out of memory; check if mysqld or some other process uses all available memory; if not, you may have to use 'ulimit' to allow mysqld to use more memory or you can add more swap space

Unknown command

Can't create IP socket
Field separator argument is not what is expected; check the manual
You can't use fixed rowlength with BLOBs; please use 'fields terminated by'
Incorrect sub part key; the used key part isn't a string, the used length is longer than the key part, or the storage engine doesn't support unique sub keys
You can't delete all columns with ALTER TABLE; use DROP TABLE instead
No tables used
The SELECT would examine more than MAX_JOIN_SIZE rows; check your WHERE and use SET SQL_BIG_SELECTS=1 or SET SQL_MAX_JOIN_SIZE=# if the SELECT is okay
Unknown error
Invalid use of group function
A table must have at least 1 column
Too many columns
Cross dependency found in OUTER JOIN; examine your ON conditions

Unable to open underlying table which is differently defined or of non-MyISAM type or doesn't exist
All parts of a PRIMARY KEY must be NOT NULL; if you need NULL in a key, use UNIQUE instead
Result consisted of more than one row
This table type requires a primary key
This version of MySQL is not compiled with RAID support
You are using safe update mode and you tried to update a table without a WHERE that uses a KEY column
Can't open table
You are not allowed to execute this command in a transaction
The storage engine for the table does not support binary table dump
Binlog closed, cannot RESET MASTER
Net error reading from master
Net error writing to master
Can't find FULLTEXT index matching the column list
Can't execute the given command because you have active locked tables or an active transaction
Some non-transactional changed tables couldn't be rolled back
Multi-statement transaction required more than 'max_binlog_cache_size' bytes of storage; increase this mysqld variable and try again
This operation cannot be performed with a running slave; run STOP SLAVE first
This operation requires a running slave; configure slave and do START SLAVE
The server is not configured as slave; fix in config file or with CHANGE MASTER TO
Could not initialize master info structure; more error messages can be found in the MySQL error log
Could not create slave thread; check system resources
You may only use constant expressions with SET
Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction
The total number of locks exceeds the lock table size
Update locks cannot be acquired during a READ UNCOMMITTED transaction
DROP DATABASE not allowed while thread is holding global read lock
CREATE DATABASE not allowed while thread is holding global read lock

Cannot add foreign key constraint
Cannot add or update a child row  a foreign key constraint fails
Cannot delete or update a parent row  a foreign key constraint fails
The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns
Can't execute the query because you have a conflicting read lock

Slave SQL thread ignored the query because of replicate-*-table rules
Key reference and table reference don't match
Subquery returns more than 1 row
Help database is corrupt or does not exist
Cyclic reference on subqueries

Slave is already running
Slave already has been stopped
ZLIB  Not enough memory
ZLIB  Not enough room in the output buffer (probably, length of uncompressed data was corrupted)
ZLIB  Input data corrupted
Cannot drop one or more of the requested users
Can't revoke all privileges for one or more of the requested users
SSL parameters in CHANGE MASTER are ignored because this MySQL slave was compiled without SSL support; they can be used later if MySQL slave with SSL is started
Incorrect parameter or combination of parameters for START SLAVE UNTIL
It is recommended to use --skip-slave-start when doing step-by-step replication with START SLAVE UNTIL; otherwise, you will get problems if you get an unexpected slave's mysqld restart
SQL thread is not to be started so UNTIL options are ignored
MySQL is started in --skip-name-resolve mode; you must restart it without this switch for this grant to work
Incorrect table definition; there can be only one TIMESTAMP column with CURRENT_TIMESTAMP in DEFAULT or ON UPDATE clause
